        <p>I'm a web developer with a primary focus on the frontend. I finished my studies in SoftUni (Bulgaria) in early 2023. My favorite frameworks are React and Next.js.</p>
        
        <p>I love working on projects that I'm passionate about. I have a lot of fun while doing it and that's my goal - to learn new things while having fun. I also enjoy reading/watching IT stuff and sci-fi movies. You can find me on the street running or in the gym.</p>

        <p>I recently decided to create a blog and I'd love to share my knowledge and experience along the way.</p>
