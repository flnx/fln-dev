        <p>I'm a web developer with a primary focus on the frontend. I finished my studies in SoftUni (Bulgaria) in early 2023.</p>
        
        <p>I love working on projects that I'm passionate about. My goal is to have fun and learn new things everyday. I also enjoy reading/watching IT related stuff, sci-fi movies, listening to podcasts and audiobooks. You can also find me on the street running or in the gym.</p>

        <p>I recently decided to create a blog and I'd love to share my knowledge and experience along the way.</p>
