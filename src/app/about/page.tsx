        <p>
          I'm a web developer with a primary focus on the frontend. I finished my
          studies in SoftUni (Bulgaria) in early 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love working on projects that I'm passionate about. My goal is to have
          fun and learn new things everyday. I also enjoy reading/watching IT related
          stuff, sci-fi movies, listening to podcasts and audiobooks. You can also
          find me on the street running or in the gym.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently decided to create a blog and I'd love to share my knowledge and
          experience along the way.
