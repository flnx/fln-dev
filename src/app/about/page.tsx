        <p>I'm a web developer with a primary focus on the frontend.</p>

        <p>
          I love building cool stuff on the internet. And by "cool stuff".. I mean
          crafting wacky inventions. The process for each new project
          is always a wild ride with a lot of factory malfunctions. But hey, I'm
          still here, still going strong, and still loving every minute of it.
        </p>

        <p>You can also find me on the street running or in the gym.</p>

        <p>
          I've recently decided to create a blog. I'll be sharing my tales of code
          triumphs and tech tribulations, hoping to provide fellow developers with
          some insights. Not only that but also to elevate my own understanding to a
          more profound level.
